# Natural Balance

This is a clicker game with the theme of sustaining earth's resources.

The goal of the game is to see how far you can get and how much energy you can generate.
You will need to make use of both renewable resources like forests and solar power,
and finite resources like coal and ore.

The player will have to find a strategy that balances the needs of humans with the needs of the earth.
